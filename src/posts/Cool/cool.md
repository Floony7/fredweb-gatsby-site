_"But that's not how we did it back in my day."_

Web development in 2020 looks radically different than it did just a few years ago, and that's a good thing.

Back in 2000, when I first learned HTML, things were fairly messy. At that time, page elements, presentation and interaction were thrown into the same HTML document. If you needed to make a tweak here and there you had to surgically find what you wanted to change by sifting through a complex page.

As the decade progressed things improved quite a lot. Presentation could be abstracted into CSS files while JavaScript files took care of the interaction layer.

Twenty years on we are fortunate to have web standards that make site development easy and faster than ever before.

##Beyond WordPress##
For most of my web development career I have leaned heavily on WordPress as a platform to build client sites. This worked well for me and my clients â€” they got a fully dynamic website and I got to write only the template code I needed to. Plugins served up rest of the functionality.

###Serverless and static###
Today, however, technology and approaches to site development have changed. The tools of a web developer have come a long way. We now have Nodejs as a runtime server to work with along with a sophisticated package manager (NPM) that provides developers with access to virtually everything we need to build modern applications and sites.

Perhaps the most exciting addition to the web development stable has been the emergence of static website generators and serverless deployment. The need for expensive infrastructure overheads and devops is now a thing of the past.

The site deployment workflow has never been easier, with services like Netlify allowing developers and companies to deploy sites and applications right from the project Git repository.

Static sites are faster and more secure because they come pre-rendered are housed in CDNs (Content Delivery Networks). This given rise to what are called Jamstack sites.

##Jamstack##
Legacy web systems are problematic for a number of reasons.

1. Websites are code constantly running on servers
1. Complex, interdependent technological stack: Web Server, Application and Database
1. Slow and inefficient
1. Opportunities at various levels for malicious attacks
1. Difficult to scale

###No server? How does stuff get done then?###

It's an obvious question, given how entrenched the legacy web system is in our collective psyche.The short answer is to use microservices and serverless functions from cloud computing companies. Instead of having to deal with server costs and associated headaches (security and inefficiencies), cloud computing services like Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS provide all the functionality you need.

Furthermore, you only pay for what you use, meaning cost efficiency and few, if any barriers to scale. Need more database capacity? No problem. Need ecommerce functionality? Just add it that as a microservice and wire it up on your site as needed. Of course, having massive companies do all the legwork as far as security is concerned means far less hassles for the inhouse IT security team.

##Developer's paradise##
Compared with just a few years ago, today's web development landscape is a paradise. The tools we have at our disposal are frankly light years beyond what we had 10 years ago. Remember jQuery? That was a step in the right direction for developers and it gave us access to a JavaScript language that badly needed reworking. JavaScript is now widely respected in the development community, with recent features including object class syntax, arrow functions and a new crop of array higher order functions.

We have the Node Package Manager (NPM) that hosts virtually any package you could want or need for development, be that an entire JavaScript library such as React or a small package that allows you to secure passwords.

There is NodeJS itself, a runtime environment that allows developers to run code at the server level. Node is what enables developers to create fullstack applications as opposed to just the "frontend" or browser development.

There are "headless CMSs", JavaScript frameworks... I could go on, but there is so much to be grateful for as a web developer in 2020, that this post could be a book in itself. I'll spare you that pain!
